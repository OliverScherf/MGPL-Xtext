# Pong mini framework

This mini framework written in Typescript is designed for simple pong browser games.

## Get it up and running
Open up a webserver in this directory:
`invaders.html` -> Invaders game
`pong.html` -> Invaders game

Make sure that you have an internet connection, as the game loads a typescript compiler to compile the game files.
